        G (nx.Graph): Weighted bipartite complete Graph with weights in [0,1].
        M (set((nx.Node,nx.Node))): A set of 2-tuples, with each 2-tuple representing a pairing of an agent in G to a good in G.
        prio (String): A string from the list ['rank_maximal', 'max_cardinality_rank_maximal', 'fair'] which specifies which criterion we want to
        enforce on the matching.

    Returns:
        A float value representing the approximation ratio of the optimal social welfare to the social welfare generated by M.
